# Test Suite - FastAPI Human-in-the-Loop Orchestration System

Comprehensive standalone Python test scripts for testing all critical functionality.

## Overview

This test suite provides **standalone Python scripts** (NOT pytest) that can be run individually or all together. Each script tests a specific component or functionality and provides clear pass/fail output with colors.

### Why Standalone Scripts Instead of pytest?

- **Independently runnable**: `python test_scripts/01_test_race_conditions.py`
- **Clear pass/fail output** with colors
- **No timeout issues**: Can fix bugs and re-run easily
- **Simple debugging**: Print statements work naturally
- **No framework overhead**: Just Python and asyncio

## Test Scripts

### Critical Fixes Tests (Priority)

These tests verify the 6 critical fixes that were just implemented:

#### 1. Race Condition Tests (`01_test_race_conditions.py`)
**Tests Fixes #1, #2, #3**: Optimistic locking, row-level locking, check order

- ✅ Concurrent workflow state transitions (optimistic locking)
- ✅ Concurrent approval responses (row-level locking)
- ✅ Double-click protection
- ✅ Approval expiry check order (expiry before status)
- ✅ Approval + timeout race condition
- ✅ Retry after concurrent modification

#### 2. Security Tests (`03_test_security.py`)
**Tests Fix #6**: Security fail-closed behavior

- ✅ Callback token generation and verification
- ✅ Token tampering detection
- ✅ Slack signature verification (valid/invalid)
- ✅ Replay attack prevention (old timestamps rejected)
- ✅ **CRITICAL**: Fail-closed when SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET not configured

#### 3. Database Performance Tests (`04_test_database_performance.py`)
**Tests Fixes #4, #5**: Database indexes and WAL mode

- ✅ WAL mode enabled
- ✅ Foreign keys enforced
- ✅ All indexes exist (workflows, events, approvals)
- ✅ Query plans use indexes
- ✅ Performance: get_workflow_events < 100ms with 1000 events
- ✅ Performance: list_workflows < 200ms with 1000 workflows
- ✅ Concurrent reads during write (WAL mode benefit)

### Component Tests

#### 4. State Machine Tests (`02_test_state_machine.py`)
- All valid state transitions
- Invalid transitions rejected
- Terminal states cannot transition
- State change events recorded
- Version increments on each transition

#### 5. Approval Flow Tests (`05_test_approval_flow.py`)

- Rejection flow
- Timeout flow
- Token-based approval access
- Approval not found errors

#### 6. Event Bus Tests (`06_test_event_bus.py`)
- Event publishing and receiving
- Multiple subscribers
- Handler failures don't block others
- Event bus lifecycle
- Multiple event types

#### 7. Timeout Manager Tests (`07_test_timeout_manager.py`)

## Test Structure

Each test script follows this structure:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Test: [Description]
Purpose: [What is being tested]
"""

import asyncio
import sys
from fixtures import (
    print_test_header, print_pass, print_fail, print_summary,
    TestContext, create_test_workflow, assert_equal
)

async def test_something():
    """Test a specific scenario"""
    async with TestContext() as ctx:
        async with ctx.get_session() as session:
            # Test code here
            pass

async def main():
    """Run all tests"""
    print_test_header("Your Test Suite Name")

    tests = [
        ("Test name", test_something),
    ]

    tests_passed = 0
    tests_failed = 0

    for test_name, test_func in tests:
        try:
            await test_func()
            print_pass(test_name)
            tests_passed += 1
        except Exception as e:
            print_fail(test_name, str(e))
            tests_failed += 1

    print_summary(tests_passed, tests_failed)
    return 0 if tests_failed == 0 else 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    exit_code = asyncio.run(main())
    sys.exit(exit_code)
```

## Test Fixtures and Helpers

The `fixtures.py` file provides:

### Test Context
```python
async with TestContext() as ctx:
    # Provides fresh database and event bus
    async with ctx.get_session() as session:
        # Use session for database operations
        pass
```

### Test Data Factories
```python
# Create test workflow
workflow = await create_test_workflow(engine, workflow_type="test", context={})

# Create test approval
approval = await create_test_approval(service, workflow_id, timeout_seconds=3600)

# Create expired approval
approval = await create_expired_approval(service, workflow_id)
```

### Assertions
```python
assert_equal(actual, expected, "message")
assert_true(condition, "message")
assert_false(condition, "message")
assert_in(item, container, "message")
await assert_raises_async(ExceptionType, coroutine)
```

### Output Helpers
```python
print_info("Informational message")
print_pass("Test name")
print_fail("Test name", "Error message")
print_summary(tests_passed, tests_failed)
```

### Event Collection
```python
collector = EventCollector()
event_bus.subscribe(EventType.WORKFLOW_STARTED, collector.handler)

# Later...
events = collector.get_events()
event = collector.find_event(workflow_id="123")
```

### Performance Timing
```python
with PerformanceTimer() as timer:
    # Code to measure
    pass

duration_ms = timer.get_duration_ms()
```

## Performance Benchmarks

Expected performance (from tests):

| Operation | Target | Test |
|-----------|--------|------|
| get_workflow_events (1000 events) | < 100ms | 04_test_database_performance.py |
| list_workflows (1000 workflows) | < 200ms | 04_test_database_performance.py |
| Create 100 workflows concurrently | < 5s | 10_test_load.py |
| Process 50 approvals concurrently | < 3s | 10_test_load.py |
| Average workflow write | < 50ms | 10_test_load.py |
| Average workflow read | < 10ms | 10_test_load.py |

## Troubleshooting

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'"

Make sure you're in the project root directory:
```bash
cd /Users/imsumit/Documents/Personal/lyzr
python test_scripts/01_test_race_conditions.py
```

### "Database is locked"

This usually means a previous test didn't clean up properly. Remove test database:
```bash
rm test_workflows.db test_workflows.db-shm test_workflows.db-wal
```

### Tests timing out

Check that:
1. Event bus is started: `await event_bus.start()`
2. Sessions are properly committed: `await session.commit()`
3. Async tasks are awaited: `await asyncio.sleep()`

### Concurrent modification errors in tests

This is expected behavior! The tests verify that concurrent modifications are properly detected and handled.

### Performance tests failing

If performance tests fail:
1. Check if running in debug mode (slower)
2. Check system load
3. Adjust performance thresholds if needed (see test file)

## Development

### Adding New Tests

1. Create new test file: `test_scripts/XX_test_name.py`
2. Copy structure from existing test
3. Use fixtures from `fixtures.py`
4. Add to `run_all_tests.sh`

### Running Tests During Development

```bash
# Fast feedback loop
python test_scripts/01_test_race_conditions.py

# Fix code...

# Re-run (no pytest cache issues!)
python test_scripts/01_test_race_conditions.py
```

### Debugging Failed Tests

Add print statements directly in test code:
```python
async def test_something():
    async with TestContext() as ctx:
        print(f"DEBUG: Creating workflow...")
        workflow = await create_test_workflow(engine)
        print(f"DEBUG: Created workflow {workflow.id}")
```

No special debugging setup needed!

## CI/CD Integration
